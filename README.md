<h1>Attorney Management System (AMS)</h1>
<h4>The Attorney Management System (AMS) is a comprehensive web streamline the operations of law firms and improve client-- based platform designed to lawyer interactions. This system offers several key functionalities, including legal case management, document management, appointment management, deed management, user affairs management, attorney management, client portal management and finance management. AMS allows senior lawyers to register and manage firm details, assign roles to lawyers such as Legal Case Ma nager, Deed Manager, and Document Manager, and oversee document approvals and client communication. Utilizing the MERN stack, AMS provides an interactive and userfriendly platform for law firm administrators, lawyers, and clients. The system facilitates the management of legal cases and deeds, document requests, appointments, and financial transactions with ease, reducing the need for manual processes. By leveraging automation, AMS significantly enhances the operational efficiency of law firms, particularly in areas such as case tracking, document submission, payment processing, and client support. Our team chose the MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, to develop AMS after careful consideration of its ability to handle the complex workflows within law firms. GitHub was used for version control to enable smooth collab oration during development. In summary, AMS provides an efficient and comprehensive solution for law firms, enabling better management of their daily tasks and improving client satisfaction through a more organized and automated approach to legal case and deed management. ii</h4>
